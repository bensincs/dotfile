      "template": "You are helping the user create a git commit following the Conventional Commits specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org).\n\n# Conventional Commits Specification\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\n1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.\n2. The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.\n3. The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.\n4. A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):\n5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.\n6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.\n7. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.\n8. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value.\n9. A footer's token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by. An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.\n10. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.\n11. If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.\n12. If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section.\n13. Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.\n14. BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.\n\n## Commit Types with Emojis\n\n- ✨ feat: A new feature (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)\n- 🐛 fix: A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)\n- 📚 docs: Documentation only changes\n- 💎 style: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)\n- 📦 refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- 🚀 perf: Performance improvement\n- 🚨 test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n- 🛠 build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies\n- ⚙️ ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts\n- 🧹 chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\n- 💥 BREAKING CHANGE: Introduces a breaking API change (correlates with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning)\n\n## Process\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a non-interactive command. Do NOT ask questions. Just execute the following steps:\n\n1. Run 'git status' to see the current state\n2. Run 'git diff --staged' to see staged changes\n3. If there are staged changes, analyze them and generate a commit message\n4. If nothing is staged, run 'git add -A' to stage all changes, then analyze them\n5. Generate a commit message following the specification above:\n   - Include the appropriate emoji at the start of the type\n   - Add a scope if changes are focused on a specific part of the codebase\n   - For complex changes, add a longer body with multiple paragraphs\n   - Add footers if needed (Reviewed-by, Refs, etc.)\n   - If this is a breaking change, add ! after the type/scope OR add a BREAKING CHANGE footer\n6. Create the commit immediately using 'git commit -m \"<message>\"' (use multiple -m flags for body/footers)\n7. Show the commit message that was created and confirm success\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple feature\n✨ feat: add user authentication\n\n### Feature with scope\n✨ feat(api): add ability to parse arrays\n\n### Bug fix with scope\n🐛 fix(parser): prevent racing of requests\n\n### Breaking change with !\n✨ feat(api)!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped\n\n### Breaking change with footer\n✨ feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files\n\n### Complex commit with body and footers\n🐛 fix: prevent racing of requests\n\nIntroduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss\nincoming responses other than from latest request.\n\nRemove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are\nobsolete now.\n\nReviewed-by: Z\nRefs: #123\n\n### Simple documentation update\n📚 docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG\n\n### Chore with breaking change\n🧹 chore!: drop support for Node 6\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.",
